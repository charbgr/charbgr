### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Vasilis and I currently live in Athens, where I'm often hanging out with friends, crossfit, producing music, writing code or relaxing in a Mediterranean beach lured with some lime margaritas.

I'm enthusiastic about modern programming languages, animations and reactive architectures. Nowadays I mostly write Kotlin but I do small steps to be full stack.

I've worked with Android for several years! Currently I am working at [Blueground](https://www.theblueground.com/). Previously I was leading the Android team at Workable.

You can reach out to me via [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/charalampakisvasilis/) and I'll try my best to get back to you. If at first I don't reply, try emailing me again ðŸ™‚. 

I'm also into contributing to open source. Sometimes I write short articles on my [blog](https://medium.com/@charbgr).
